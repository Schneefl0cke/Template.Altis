This is the HEC Template. It is still WIP.

Night Vision Googles are added if your starting time is in the night hours.

To add a loadout, 
1. add it in the loadouts\CfgFunctions.hpp like the others. 
2. write the loadout. Orient on other loadouts
3. add the loadout to the fn_prepareLoadout, so a player gets it on missionstart
4. add a menu to the functions\ fn_addLoadoutmenu.sqf
